# Statistics

### Mean
use when no outliers

### Median
- use when outliers are there
- if odd, median is middle value
- if even, avg of middle values

### Mode
- used if there is an outlier and the majority of the data is the same
- most occurring value

### Standard Deviation
- $SD = \sqrt{Variance}$
- used to identify outliers
- Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual

### Covariance
Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary from each other

### Correlation
- a normalized form of covariance
- ranges -1 to +1
- aka pearsons correlation coefficient
- helpful in detecting label leakage

### Data Skew
- when the normal distribution curve is not symmetric

### Z-Score
Scaled value = (value âˆ’ mean) / stddev
