# Semi-Supervised Learning

- Train model on small dataset which is labeled
- Use this model to label the unlabeled dataset
- Use newly labeled dataset to improve the model

## Use cases 
- Fraud detection or anomaly detection 
- Clustering 
- Speech recognition 
- Web content classification 
- Text document classification

## Limitations

If the portion of labeled data isnâ€™t representative of the entire distribution, the approach may fall short.
