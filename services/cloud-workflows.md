# Cloud Workflows

Cloud Workflows orchestrate multiple HTTPS based services into a durable and stateful workflow.

great for:
- chaining microservices together
- automating infrastructure tasks (like starting or stopping a VM)
- integrating with external systems

has connectors for GCP services like [Cloud Storage](cloud-storage.md) and [BigQuery](bigquery.md)

if used with [Cloud Scheduler](cloud-scheduler.md), is a good alternative for [Cloud Function](cloud-function.md)
