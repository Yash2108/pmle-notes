## Vertex AI Vizier

- optimization service to tune hyperparameters
- Doesnt have a known objective function and is too costly to evaluate using one
- can optimize other tasks as well

Example use case:
- Optimize LR, Batch Size, etc
- Optimize usability of an application by testing different arrangements of UI elements
- Minimizing computing resources by identifying ideal buffer size and thread count
- Optimize amount of ingredients in a recipe to produce the most delicious version

The Vizier is an independent service. Hyperparameter tuning for custom training is a built-in feature that uses Vertex AI Vizier.
