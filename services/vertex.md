## Vertex AI Vizier

- optimization service to tune hyperparameters
- Doesnt have a known objective function and is too costly to evaluate using one
- can optimize other tasks as well

Example use case:
- Optimize LR, Batch Size, etc
- Optimize usability of an application by testing different arrangements of UI elements
- Minimizing computing resources by identifying ideal buffer size and thread count
- Optimize amount of ingredients in a recipe to produce the most delicious version

The Vizier is an independent service. Hyperparameter tuning for custom training is a built-in feature that uses Vertex AI Vizier.

## Vertex [Explainable AI](ml-topics/explainable-ai)

The following services are supported:
- AutoML image models (classification only)
- AutoML tabular models (classification and regression only)
- Custom TF models on image data
- Custom TF models on tabular data

### Feature Attribution

is done using three methods:
1. Sampled Shapley
2. Integrated Gradients
	1. provides local feature importance
	2. doesnt provide global feature importance
	3. doesnt explain feature interactions and combinations
4. XRAI (eXplanation with Ranked Area Integrals)

#### Differentiable Models
All operations in the model are differentiable. Ex: Neural Networks
Preferred Method: Integrated Gradients
#### Non-Differentiable Models
The models that include non-differentiable operations like rounding or decoding.
Example: An ensemble of Neural Network and Decision Tree.
Preferred Method: Sampled Shapley


### Explanations available after configuration

- Online Explanations
	- Synchronous requests to the Vertex AI API. Similar to online predictions
	- Returns predictions with feature attribution
- Batch Explanations
	- Asynchronous requests. 
- Local Kernel Explanations
	- For custom trained models. 


## Vertex AI Pipelines

can use this to run [Kubeflow Pipelines](kubeflow.md#Kubeflow%20Pipelines) or Tensorflow Extended pipelines

serverless

provides [data lineage](ml-topics/lineage.md)

## ML Metadata

terminology used:
- #### Metadata store
	- top-level container for all metadata resources
	- usually, 1 metadata is shared by entire org
- #### Metadata resources
	- ##### Artifacts
		- is an entity or piece of data that was created or can be used by an ML workflow
	- ##### Context
		- group of artifacts and executions
		- you are optimizing hyperparameters; each experiment would be a different execution with its own set of parameters and metrics. You can group these experiments into a context and then compare the metrics in this context to identify the best model.
	- ##### Execution
		- represents a step in ML workflow
		- ![Vertex Metadata data model](attachments/vertex-metadata-data-model.png)
	- ##### Events
		- connects artifacts and executions
	- ##### MetaDataSchema
		- schema which is used by particular datatypes like artifact or execution
		- represented using OpenAPI schema objects in YAML format
